Place the blob elements behind the hero card so that parts

  /*^^
  I was writing z-index: 3; for hero card and z-index: 1 and 2 for the blobs and it wasn't working.  
  When you apply z-index + position to an element, you create a new stacking context. Children with z-index: -1 canâ€™t escape that context, so they can't visually go behind their parent anymore. Moving the blobs outside solves that but we don't wan't to create more code or change the html so we just remove the z index from the hero-card.
